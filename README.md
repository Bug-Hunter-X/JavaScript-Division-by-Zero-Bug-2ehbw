This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript: division by zero. The initial code (`bug.js`) contains a function `foo` that performs division. However, it lacks comprehensive error handling, resulting in a runtime error when the second argument is zero. The solution (`bugSolution.js`) adds checks for both zero arguments, thus preventing errors and producing more robust behavior.
